So, what all these stuff is doing is that it keeps the previous \\K stuff and then replaces the \\K stuff with what you want to replace it with. So, what this means is that, it is matching the non-space, non-comment, and non-digits at the beginning of the string up to the first [] or () that it can find. Then it creates a match that matches the whole of what it just matched plus everything that is after it. So, all \\K stuff is replaced with the stuff that it matched \\K the first thing that it matched. Here, \\s* matches a whole bunch of characters without spaces. \\s matches a sequence of characters that are not spaces.\\nSo, what we do here, first, is match up to the first [] or () and say that I want what is after and I want what is before what I just matched \\K. Then, once I get to that portion, I match everything that is after it. So, all of it. Now, the other stuff is this \\K stuff. So, \\K is \\K \\s and \\K is everything that is matched and didn't get replaced. So, this matches all of the characters after what is the first thing that you matched \\K and everything else that it matched. Then, it replaces it with the part that you want it to replace it with. So, that is an example of how \\K stuff is treated and what it matches.\\ngsub also returns the matched string, so it is optional in this example. In other examples, instead of \\K, or \\s, it would be passed in and you would do</td>\n",

So, what all these stuff is doing is that it keeps the previous \\K stuff and then replaces the \\K stuff with what you want to replace it with. So, what this means is that, it is matching the non-space, non-comment, and non-digits at the beginning of the string up to the first [] or () that it can find. Then it creates a match that matches the whole of what it just matched plus everything that is after it. So, all \\K stuff is replaced with the stuff that it matched \\K the first thing that it matched. Here, \\s* matches a whole bunch of characters without spaces. \\s matches a sequence of characters that are not spaces.\\nSo, what we do here, first, is match up to the first [] or () and say that I want what is after and I want what is before what I just matched \\K. Then, once I get to that portion, I match everything that is after it. So, all of it. Now, the other stuff is this \\K stuff. So, \\K is \\K \\s and \\K is everything that is matched and didn't get replaced. So, this matches all of the characters after what is the first thing that you matched \\K and everything else that it matched. Then, it replaces it with the part that you want it to replace it with. So, that is an example of how \\K stuff is treated and what it matches.\\ngsub also returns the matched string, so it is optional in this example. In other examples, instead of \\K, or \\s, it would be passed in and you would do  \n",

If you really want to build a parser from the ground up, you need to find the basic ideas of parsing in a language (what a parse looks like). Also, even though the parsing technique you want to use (chomsky normal form or yacc) is pretty well-documented, there are other things to learn (especially in a context like python that allows a lot of parentheses and commas, etc., to be used.  \n",

The number can be divided into 100 groups (the groups would be based on the type of digit that each digit is).  The type of number can be determined based on the last number or group of numbers (e.g. the last number would be the 5th, 10th, or 100th since all of those have the highest number of groups that consists of different types of numbers.  \\nHow do I find the type of number?\\nWe can use the .{1,4}.{3,4} regex to define the rule (and .*? can be omitted if it does not match because nothing is consumed by the regex).  The first and the last (or only time there is one) digit in a group of a number is of type 3 (since there are 4 types).\\nIf all of the digits have an even number of groups (or only two or three digits have odd numbers of groups), the number is a normal number.  Otherwise, the number is floating or a variable-length integer number.  That means that:\\n\\nFully Floating: a Floating number has one number that has an even number of groups and a value that is determined by the digits that follow.\\nVariable Length: The length of the final result is the sum of the lengths of each number that precedes it.  In cases of floating numbers only, this is the total number of digits.  If at least one of the digits has an even number of groups, then the result of the final number is also the number of digits that follow this last number.  In other words, the final number is the maximum number of digits.  This is not the largest value.\\n\\nLet's see some of these examples:\\nExamples: F\\n.{1,4}.{3,4}: F (Fully Floating)\\n.{1.2,3}: FF\\n.{1.1,2}: F\\n.</td>\n",

The number can be divided into 100 groups (the groups would be based on the type of digit that each digit is).  The type of number can be determined based on the last number or group of numbers (e.g. the last number would be the 5th, 10th, or 100th since all of those have the highest number of groups that consists of different types of numbers.  \\nHow do I find the type of number?\\nWe can use the .{1,4}.{3,4} regex to define the rule (and .*? can be omitted if it does not match because nothing is consumed by the regex).  The first and the last (or only time there is one) digit in a group of a number is of type 3 (since there are 4 types).\\nIf all of the digits have an even number of groups (or only two or three digits have odd numbers of groups), the number is a normal number.  Otherwise, the number is floating or a variable-length integer number.  That means that:\\n\\nFully Floating: a Floating number has one number that has an even number of groups and a value that is determined by the digits that follow.\\nVariable Length: The length of the final result is the sum of the lengths of each number that precedes it.  In cases of floating numbers only, this is the total number of digits.  If at least one of the digits has an even number of groups, then the result of the final number is also the number of digits that follow this last number.  In other words, the final number is the maximum number of digits.  This is not the largest value.\\n\\nLet's see some of these examples:\\nExamples: F\\n.{1,4}.{3,4}: F (Fully Floating)\\n.{1.2,3}: FF\\n.{1.1,2}: F\\n.  \n",
       "3  Task Output: (I want X to do Y which is the same as saying that Y is a way of X)\\nResult: A relation.\\n\\nThis is a good idea because it is a problem where the solution depends on the domain.\\n\\nIn this case we would use a rule like:\\n\\nThere is a relation between X and Y if and only if (there would be)\\n\\nor \\nTo solve the problem in a more flexible manner, you could use a list of relations as follows:\\n\\nList of relations\\nTo check whether there is a relation between X and Y use the following rule:\\n\\nThere is a relation between X and Y.\\n\\nand then write out a list of relations that would satisfy this rule (e.g. A, B, C), and that would also be a relation like above. Then use the same rule above to check which of the relations satisfied this rule and then write the corresponding relations below them. In this way, the relations would be sorted by the relation they satisfy.\\n\\nThere is a relation between X and Y if and only if\\n\\n \\nThere is also \\n\\nand the first is a relation that is not already in the first one.\\n\\nThe list could include relations that are a relation above the one under the relation (e.g. A, B, C, D are all above A).\\n\\nTo check whether there is a relation between X and Y, you can try various combinations and apply your reasoning. Here is an attempt to illustrate how it could be done:\\n\\nThis is not a relation.\\n\\n (there is not anything that is X is a relation to Y.\\n\\nYou can also ask \"How the heck is that even a relationship? It's not correct\" but you get into this sort of nonsense that is beyond questioners mind. So, the rule can become too much work.\\nIf none of these are a solution, maybe adding some sort of test like in (3) would allow you to know which one in (1) would suit.\\n\\nA:\\n\\nHere's one way to implement a Relation as a data type (I didn't want to leave aside the semantic part, but you may try to  \n",

    "The **Pythia** model showed some understanding of the task prompts but struggled to produce structured and coherent outputs for tasks such as constituency parsing, dependency parsing, and semantic role labeling. While its results reflected some syntactic awareness, they were overly verbose and deviated from the expected formats, often including irrelevant or extraneous information. For example, in the dependency parsing task, Pythia generated a detailed word-to-word dependency list but failed to maintain conciseness and interpretability. Its abstract meaning representation (AMR) outputs were also imprecise, displaying partial alignment with the sentence's semantic structure. These limitations highlight Pythia's general-purpose design, making it less effective for structured NLP tasks without fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **T5** model exhibited better performance than Pythia in terms of output relevance and task-specific accuracy. Its sequence-to-sequence architecture helped it align with parsing tasks like constituency parsing and AMR, where the results were closer to the expected format. For example, T5's semantic role labeling demonstrated better identification of agents and actions compared to Pythia, albeit still lacking detail in some complex cases. However, like Pythia, T5 also struggled with tasks requiring deeper semantic understanding, such as coreference resolution and AMR, producing inconsistent and partial results. Overall, T5's outputs were more concise and task-focused than Pythia's, but it still requires fine-tuning for robust handling of such specialized tasks.\n"

    "The **GPT-4 implementation** demonstrated a significantly higher level of accuracy and task-specific relevance compared to Pythia and T5, showcasing its ability to handle complex NLP tasks with minimal instruction. For example, in constituency parsing and semantic role labeling, GPT-4 produced well-structured and interpretable outputs closely aligning with linguistic expectations. Additionally, its abstract meaning representation (AMR) and coreference resolution tasks reflected a deeper semantic understanding of the sentences, capturing nuanced relationships between entities and actions. However, GPT-4 occasionally included extraneous details or verbose explanations in certain outputs, which could be mitigated by refining the prompt for concise responses.
